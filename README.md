This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.\n
A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row:- \n
● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.\n
● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.\n
● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.\n
● Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.\n
